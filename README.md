# Autonomous Forwarder Simulation in NVIDIA Isaac Sim

## Overview
This project involves the simulation of an autonomous forwarder (forestry machine) using NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The simulation aims to replicate real-world forestry operations, allowing for testing and development of autonomous functionalities. Why? I was chatting with a few people about an [autonomous skidder](https://youtu.be/UaA2p-A8F0Q?si=esHC8dTE9EqiKWwM) and thought to myself, "I know how to use Isaac Sim. Why not try to make an autonomous forwarder there?" So here we are. This is still in REALLY early stages of development so don't expect much. Readme was generated by gpt so uh dont follow any instructions there might be.
